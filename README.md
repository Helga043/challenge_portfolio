# Task 1 Software configuration.
### Subtask1 Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?

Hello, my name is Helga!

Recently, I decided to start my way in QA. 

I saw this project online and liked the approach, the design, and the availability of the Buddy sub-project.
I believe that support when learning something new is very important.
And I also think that this opportunity will be an interesting challenge for me.

My goal is to learn as much as possible about automated testing, have some practice, and ideally also to get a job or a base to find a new job.
